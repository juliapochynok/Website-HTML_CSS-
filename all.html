                "Short for HyperText Markup Language, the authoring language used to create documents on the World Wide Web. HTML is similar to SGML, although it is not a strict subset.
                <br>
                HTML defines the structure and layout of a Web document by using a variety of tags and attributes. The correct structure for an HTML document starts with &lt HTML &gt &lt HEAD &gt(enter here what document is about)&lt BODY &gt and ends with &lt/ BODY &gt &lt/HTML &gt. All the information you'd like to include in your Web page fits in between the <BODY> and </BODY> tags.
                <br>
                There are hundreds of other tags used to format and layout the information in a Web page. Tags are also used to specify hypertext links. These allow Web developers to direct users to other Web pages with only a click of the mouse on either an image or word(s).

                    Stands for "Cascading Style Sheet." Cascading style sheets are used to format the layout of Web pages. They can be used to define text styles, table sizes, and other aspects of Web pages that previously could only be defined in a page's HTML.
                    <br>
                    CSS helps Web developers create a uniform look across several pages of a Web site. Instead of defining the style of each table and each block of text within a page's HTML, commonly used styles need to be defined only once in a CSS document. Once the style is defined in cascading style sheet, it can be used by any page that references the CSS file. Plus, CSS makes it easy to change styles across several pages at once. For example, a Web developer may want to increase the default text size from 10pt to 12pt for fifty pages of a Web site. If the pages all reference the same style sheet, the text size only needs to be changed on the style sheet and all the pages will show the larger text.

                HISTORY OF HTML.
            </h1>
            <h2 class="desc">
                    HTML was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991 but was not released officially, which was published in 1995 as HTML 2.0. HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999 and was a major version of HTML.
                    <br>
                    HTML is a very evolving markup language and has evolved with various versions updating. Long before its revised standards and specifications are carried in, each version has allowed its user to create web pages in the much easier and prettier way and make sites very efficient.
                    <br>
                    - HTML 1.0 was released in 1993 with the intention of sharing information which can be readable and accessible via web browsers. But not much of the developers were involved in creating websites. So the language was also not growing.
                    <br>
                    - Then comes the HTML 2.0, published in 1995; which contains all the features of HTML 1.0 along with that few additional features; which remained as the standard markup language for designing and creating websites until January 1997 and refined various core features of HTML.
                    <br>
                    - Then comes the HTML 3.0, where Dave Raggett who introduced a fresh paper or draft on HTML. It included improved new features of HTML, giving more powerful characteristics for webmasters in designing web pages. But these powerful features of new HTML slowed down the browser in applying further improvements.
                    <br>
                    - Then comes the HTML 4.01 which is widely used and was a successful version of HTML before HTML 5.0, which is currently released and used worldwide. HTML 5 can be said for as an extended version of HTML 4.01 which was published in the year 2012.

               HISTORY OF CSS.
            </h1>
            <h2 class="desc">
                    Like HTML, CSS is standardized by the W3 consortium. CSS is an open, independent and freely usable standard. As with HTML, a working group exists for CSS who concerns itself with development of the standard. This is being done in accordance with W3C rules.
                    <br>
                    CSS comes in different versions. CSS level 1 was released in 1996, and republished with corections in 1999. CSS level 2 appeared in 1998 and built on CSS level 1. CSS level 2 adds support for different output media. CSS 3 is currently in development and will be split up in modules.
                    <br>
                    The idea behind it was to seperate presentation and content of a web site. The advantage of this approach is that updates and changes to the presentation need only be applied once (to the stylesheet) to affect all pages. Especially large sites can achieve significant time savings. In order to enforce this separation of concerns, the W3C has deprecated the &lt font &gt tag in HTML 4. Newer (X)HTML versions will deprecate other tags in a similar vein.
                    <br>
                    CSS stylesheets are an immediate addition to HTML. CSS is a language to define format properties of HTML or XML tags. HTML has reached the end of it's shelf life and is not being developed further. XHTML is the new standard instead. XHTML reformulates HTML with XML syntax while at the same time getting rid of presentational markup. XHTML only contains content, presentation is the domain of a CSS stylesheet. This allows for different stylesheets for different output formats such as print, aural or small devices. Search machines on the other hand have an easier job if they are only presented with content markup.
